Minimum Requirements
- svr_info requires glibc version 2.14 or newer. Typically, this version is
  available on Ubuntu 14.04 and CentOS 7 or newer.
- svr_info requires the tar utility be installed on the target system.

2.0.0
Notable Interface Changes (from 1.x to 2.x)
 - The program name has changed from svr_info to svr-info.
 - The command line arguments can be accessed with a single or double dash, e.g., -cpu or --cpu.
 - HTML, JSON, and XLSX report types are generated by default. Override with the -format command line argument.
 - HTML and XLSX report data is presented on multiple tabs.
 - Combined (all_hosts.*) HTML and XLSX reports will be generated by default when there are two or more hosts specified in the targets file.
 - The JSON report data structure has changed significantly.
 - The CSV report type has been removed.
Features Added
 - System profiling option added (-profile). Collects system performance metrics at configurable frequency (see help).
 - A rules engine is used to offer system configuration recommendations based on current configuration. Rules are configurable.
 - Megadata (--megadata) feature optionally captures additional information in a series of text files. Information collected is configurable.
 - Data from multiple hosts combined into one sheet in combined/multi-host Excel report
 - Excel, HTML and JSON reports now rendered from same data structure for consistency across report types
 - Display versions of Python, Java, and OpenSSL in report
 - Temporary directories now include "svr-info" in their name to more easily identify their origin
 - Full support for Sapphire Rapids - performance reference data, PMU registers, frequency measurement, accelerators
 Bugs Fixed
 - Display full name of CentOS release in report
 - Correctly render DIMM population chart for SPR 8 socket system
 - Do not attempt to resolve hostname during input parameter validation as it may fail under certain circumstances
 - Passwords that include a dollar sign are now supported in targets file if dollar sign proceeded by a backslash
 - If the tar utility is not on the target, display a reasonable error message
Known Issues
- The storage micro-benchmark may not run on CentOS due to locale settings.
- HTML report may scroll out of view when menu is minimized when window is small.

1.4.0
Features Added
- Various report additions and format improvements
- Detect Intel GPUs and report model name
- Report more ISA extensions, e.g. AMX and VAES
- Detection of QAT on platform
- Display PPIN for all installed CPUs
- Ice Lake reference performance data updated
- Sapphire Rapids (D-Step) reference performance data added
- Command line option --input will now search the given directory recursively for .out files
- Align csv/Excel report structure with HTML report
Bugs Fixed
- Can now measure core frequency on Sapphire Rapids
Known Issues
- The storage micro-benchmark may not run on CentOS 8 due to locale settings.
- svr_info will fail to run on a fresh install of CentOS 8 because tar is not installed by default
- passwords that include a dollar sign are not supported for remote target data collection

1.3.0
Features Added
- Support for Sapphire Rapids (no reference performance data)
- Update Ice Lake reference performance data
- Cleanup HTML report layout and add new Power section
- Improved default host data collection performance
Bugs Fixed
- Excel formatted report generation would fail when host names were longer than 32 characters
- Removed micro-benchmarks that measure network metrics due to inconsistency
Known Issues
- The storage micro-benchmark may not run on CentOS 8 due to locale settings.

1.2.4
Features Added
- Recognize additional CPUs for report generation

1.2.3
Bugs Fixed
- Update collector to fix issue with PATH on CentOS 7

1.2.2
Bugs Fixed
- CSV report crash on GCP due to NIC naming scheme in lshw output

1.2.1
Bugs Fixed
- Error when retrieving maximum frequency from dmidecode output

1.2.0
Features Added
- DIMM rank now included in DIMM table
- Maximum Frequency and All-core Maximum Frequency now included in CPU details
Bugs Fixed
- Prefetcher MSRs now retrieved after installing msr kernel driver
- Base Frequency now retrieved from more reliable source
- Data collection now succeeds when PATH is exported in ~/.bashrc on target machine

1.1.0
Features Added
- add support for Ice Lake and Cooper Lake Xeon processors
- add support for Kaby Lake and Coffee Lake Core processors
- reports now include PMU in-use detection
- csv and xlsx reports expanded and reorganized
Bugs Fixed

- connection to remote target times out when no user_id is specified
- connection to remote target fails -- retry up to 3 times
- using --ip without --user fails to connect to remote target
- failed to collect requested information if user is 'root'
- crash on AWS EC2 g4dn.metal
- crash if ports used for network performance test are in use
